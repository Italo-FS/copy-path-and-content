# Copy Path and Content

A simple extension that allows you to quickly copy the **relative path** of a file and the **content** of the selected file—whether it's a single file, multiple files, or an entire folder.

This will copy to your clipboard:

~~~javascript
//relative/path/to/file.ext
<file content>
~~~
